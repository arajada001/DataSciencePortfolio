# Arajada Ganesh Babu - Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases projects completed as part of my Post Graduation in Data Science from Purdue University (October 2025). With over 13 years of experience in aviation and hospitality operations, I am transitioning into a data science career, applying machine learning and analytics to solve real-world problems. I am currently based in Berlin, Germany, seeking entry-level Data Scientist roles (Job Seeker Visa until April 2026, eligible for EU Blue Card).

- **Description**: Developed advanced regression models (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) on Kaggle’s housing dataset, improving accuracy with feature engineering.
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
- **Outcome**: Achieved enhanced model performance for real estate predictions.

### 3. Salary Prediction
- **File**: `Regression_salary prediction.ipynb`
- **Description**: Created a linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience, evaluated with MAE, MAPE, and R² metrics.
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn
- **Outcome**: Validated predictive accuracy for HR analytics.

### 4. Customer Segmentation with K-Means
- **File**: `Kmeans Clustering.ipynb`
- **Description**: Applied K-Means clustering on mall customer data to segment based on income and spending, visualized with Seaborn scatter plots.
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
- **Outcome**: Identified customer segments for targeted marketing.

### 5. Student Performance Prediction
- **File**: `Reg_Stu_performance.ipynb`
- **Description**: Built a regression model to predict performance index using student data, including visualizations to highlight key predictors.
- **Tools**: Python, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Outcome**: Provided insights into educational performance factors.

### 6. Logistic Regression Classification
- **File**: `Logistic Regression(Classification).ipynb`
- **Description**: Implemented logistic regression on a social network ads dataset to predict purchases, evaluated with accuracy and ROC curve.
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn
- **Outcome**: Demonstrated binary classification skills.

### 7. Association Rule Mining
- **File**: `Association Mining.ipynb`
- **Description**: Used Apriori algorithm on transaction data to discover frequent itemsets and association rules for market basket analysis.
- **Tools**: Python, mlxtend
- **Outcome**: Generated insights for retail optimization.

### 8. Random Forest & XGBoost Regression
- **File**: `Random Forest XGD Regression.ipynb`
- **Description**: Built ensemble models on the diabetes dataset to predict disease progression, achieving high accuracy (93% OOB score).
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Outcome**: Showcased advanced regression techniques.

### 9. Data Visualization
- **File**: `Vizualisation (2).ipynb`
- **Description**: Performed exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset with visualizations (e.g., factor plots) to analyze survival rates.
- **Tools**: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Outcome**: Enhanced storytelling through data visualization.
